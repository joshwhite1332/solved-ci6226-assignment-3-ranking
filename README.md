Assignment

In this assignment we continue building an information retrieval system based on the results of Assignments 1 and 2.

The task in this assignment is to <strong>add ranking</strong> to your search engine.

This assignment is deliberately left as open-ended as possible to provide you with a higher degree of freedom in your design choices.  You are free to implement any ranking approach that was discussed in the course.  You are also free to implement ranking that was not in the course; in that case, please provide references.

In your report, give a brief overview of the ranking algorithm that you are using and illustrate it with a comparison of search results with and without the ranking feature.  Devise an experiment that illustrates correctness of your implementation of ranking.
